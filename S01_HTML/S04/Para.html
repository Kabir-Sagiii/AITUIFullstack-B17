  Visual Studio Code is built with extensibility in mind. From the UI to the
  editing experience, almost every part of VS Code can be customized and
  enhanced through the Extension API. In fact, many core features of VS Code are
  built as extensions and use the same Extension API.Visual Studio Code is built

  Copilot agent mode is the next evolution in AI-assisted coding. Acting as an
  autonomous peer programmer, it performs multi-step coding tasks at your
  command â€” analyzing your codebase, reading relevant files, proposing file
  edits, and running terminal commands and tests. It responds to compile and
  lint errors, monitors terminal and test output, and auto-corrects in a loop
  until the task is completed. Available to all VS Code Insiders users today,
  and soon in VS Code Stable.
